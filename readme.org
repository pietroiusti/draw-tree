draw-tree

Display tree of cons cells.

Ported to Emacs Lisp from Nils M Holm's Scheme 9 from Empty Space's
Function Library (http://www.t3x.org/s9fes/draw-tree.scm.html) and its
Common Lisp port written by CBaggers
(https://github.com/cbaggers/draw-cons-tree).

Placed in the Public Domain.

Example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (draw-tree '((a) (b . c) (d e))) ;; ==> 
;; "
;; [o|o]---[o|o]---[o|/]
;;  |       |       |      
;; [o|/]    |      [o|o]---[o|/]
;;  |       |       |       |      
;;  a       |       d       e      
;;          |      
;;         [o|o]--- c      
;;          |
